Respected Sir/madam,
             I am S.Lahari Sai Bharani I choose Contact Manager App (Fullstack Application) for this i develop a front end and back end.
             Back-end zip size file is 96mb. i try to upload my file but the github minimum size is 25mb thats why I am uploading my front-end zip file along with that
             I am uploading all the screenshots(both front & back-end) are shared in this link.
             If you consider google drive link then i will upload my back-end file also.
             
             
Front End Softwares:
